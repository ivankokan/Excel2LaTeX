**Version 3.0: Released on Nov 17 2010**
 * **CAVEAT:** The toolbar buttons and menu items from previous versions of Excel2LaTeX are not deleted automatically.
 * **CAVEAT:** Depending on the formatting of your table, you might require the following packages not required before:
   * `bigstrut`
   * `rotating`
   * `multirow`
 * Stored tables: See annotations above.
 * More cell formatting options are used in the converted table.
 * Cells with rotated contents are supported. Requires the `rotating` package.
 * Multirow and multirow-multicolumn cells are supported.  Requires the `multirow` package.
 * A cell formatted as bold and containing inline math formulae is typeset in bold using `\boldmath` and `\unboldmath`
 * More precise typesetting of cell borders in non-booktabs mode.
   * A column is assumed to have a vertical border if there is a border in any row of this column. Cells with a vertical
     border different from the default or without vertical border are typeset using the `\multicol` command, specifying 
     the border type for this cell.  If both single and double lines are present in one column, a double line is assumed
     as default for this column.
   * Horizontal rules are typeset using `\cline` if they do not go straight through from left to right.  Double horizontal
     lines are converted to single lines in this case.
   * `\bigstrut` commands are inserted where appropriate.  The number of struts required for a multirow cell is computed
     correctly.  Requires the `bigstrut` package.
 * Bug fix: The type of the left border of a multicolumn cell is determined correctly (in non-booktabs mode).
 * Improved file name handling.
   * The target `.tex` file will be stored in the directory of the Excel worksheet by default.
   * If the target `.tex` file resides in the directory of the worksheet or in a subdirectory, a relative path to the file is stored.
 * The main form is now modeless.  The worksheet can be edited while the form is open.
   * Changes to the contents of the selection are tracked, the LaTeX table in the text box is updated automatically.
     Changes to cell formatting (font style, borders) are not tracked.
   * The current selection can be set as source range for the current conversion to LaTeX by hitting the large button at the top
     of the dialog.
 * The main form shows up always, even if no range or a multi-area range is selected.

**Version 2.3: Released on Nov 16 2010**
 * Bug fix: In Office 2007, no error is raised after opening a document anymore.
